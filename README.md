Analyzing the weather conditions with global warming. 
Overview:- In this assignment, we will examine how Global Warming affects the weather. Like, it's the weather's frequency, intensity, and amount of rainfall in different years. Overall, we will examine how and why weather changes due to Global Warming.
Background and Reference: - I have read some of the papers published in this field, and I got many points from there. Many works are already done in this field and paper are published too.
A published paper (DOI number:- 10.1038/NGEO2253 and Title: - Atmospheric circulation as a source of uncertainty in climate change projections) that i have read concluded that how Global Mean Surface Temperature is increasing every year, Arctic summer sea ice extent is decreasing by every passing year. Also, the standard deviation of Sea-level pressure, Precipitation and Surface air temperature are increasing (data is spread from the mean).
Analyzing weather conditions and their evolving relationship with global warming reveals a troubling pattern. Over the years, the data indicates a consistent increase in global mean surface temperature, which aligns with the findings of the paper titled "Atmospheric circulation as a source of uncertainty in climate change projections" (DOI 10.1038/NGEO2253). This upward trend is a direct consequence of the escalating levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the diminishing extent of Arctic summer sea ice year after year underscores the alarming impact of global warming on polar regions. Concurrently, the standard deviation of sea-level pressure, precipitation, and surface air temperature is expanding, signifying growing variability and uncertainty in these vital meteorological parameters. Such alterations in weather attributes pose significant challenges to our understanding of climate patterns and underline the need for comprehensive actions to mitigate the consequences of global warming.
As we delve deeper into the implications of these changes, it becomes evident that the frequency, intensity, and rainfall patterns are being significantly influenced by global warming. The increasing temperature has led to shifts in weather patterns, impacting the frequency of extreme weather events such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall. These changes are not isolated incidents but are interconnected and perpetuated by the changes in atmospheric circulation mentioned in the paper. Such findings emphasize the urgency of addressing global warming and its complex impact on weather. As we continue to analyze these phenomena, we must also consider regional variations, as the effects are not uniform across the globe. This report seeks to contribute to the ongoing dialogue on global warming and weather conditions, with the ultimate goal of driving action and policy changes to counter the adverse effects of climate change.
